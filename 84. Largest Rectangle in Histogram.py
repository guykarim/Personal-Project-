Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

 

Example 1:


Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
Example 2:


Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= heights.length <= 105
0 <= heights[i] <= 104
